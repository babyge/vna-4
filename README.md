# Open Hardware Vector Network Analyzer
I'm developing a proof of concept two port microwave vector network analyzer. The project is under developent.
[Ongoing documentation and logs are located on a hackaday.io project page.](https://hackaday.io/project/26213-vector-network-analyzer)

## Usage
This project is still under development, y'all probably don't want to try reproducing it yet.
Testing with two port measurements out to 13 GHz is in progress.
